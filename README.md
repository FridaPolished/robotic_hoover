### Background and Overview
This is an implementation of a virtual robotic hoover (Roomba-like).


The robotic hoover gets the data to start running from a .txt file that lives in the same directory.

##### Constraints

The robot does not encounter any obstacles on the area that is cleaning and stays put when it bumps into a wall.

### Features

The program extracts the information from the .txt file by using JQuery the data is used in later functions to parse it and run the hooover.


It displays the final position of the robot and the dirt collected after running in all the directions provided in the input. This information is visible on a DOM element and on the browser terminal.
